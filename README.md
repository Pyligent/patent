### Method for optimal path selection in traversal of packets through network address translators

#### Publication number: 20050259637   
Abstract: Reduction of administrative overhead in maintaining network information, rapid convergence on an optimal routing 
path through the data network, and utilization of only required network resources are realized by a novel method for 
establishing a call path between network users. The method is based upon deployment of a network information server that 
stores network topology information and that is addressable by each end user. In this method, the network information server 
receives a request to establish a call path. The request identifies at least the calling party. In response to the request, 
the network information server determines a network traversal between the calling party and a root network wherein the network
traversal includes call path information about the sub-networks between the calling party and the root network. The request 
for establishing a call path can also identify the called party.
